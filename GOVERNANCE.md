# API Enhancement Proposals: Project Charter

## Article I: Purpose

1. The API Extension Proposals (AEP) project exists to help developers and
   organizations build clear, consistent network APIs and clients by providing
   an extensible set of design guidelines (AEPs) and an ecosystem of tools to
   apply those rules in practice.
2. To support this aim, the project provides and maintains tools that enrich
   the experience of developing and using APIs that conform to the project's
   design guidelines by generating artifacts such as client libraries and
   documentation.

## Article II: Association

1. The AEP project aims to be a project of the Cloud Native Computing
   Foundation. As such, it accepts the [CNCF Code of Conduct][0].

## Article III: Steering Committee

1. The AEP project shall be governed by a steering committee, comprising at
   least five representatives from at least five distinct organizations.
2. No more than one third of the committee shall represent or be employed by
   the same organization.
   1. In the event that ambiguities arise regarding what constitutes "the same
      organization," a vote of the committee shall decide. Any members from the
      organizations under consideration may deliberate, but shall recuse
      themselves from the vote.
3. Membership on the steering committee shall be by invitation of the current
   steering committee. The steering committee shall meet at least once annually
   to consider the addition, removal, or replacement of members.
4. The members of the steering committee shall be maintained in a
   MAINTAINERS.md file in the
   [primary AEP GitHub repository](https://github.com/aep-dev/aep.dev).
5. Steering committee members accept the following responsibilities:
   1. Ownership of the charter, vision, and direction of the AEP project.
   2. Regular attendance and participation at stated committee meetings.
   3. Contribution of design guidance or code as appropriate, and reviewing the
      contributions of others.
6. Steering committee members who are unable or unwilling to continue to
   perform the responsibilities described above may voluntarily step down from
   the committee or may be removed from the steering committee without
   prejudice. Former committee members will be designated as "emeritus" in the
   maintainers list.
7. The steering committee may appoint additional maintainers, to whom it may
   delegate tasks as necessary.

## Article IV: Source of Truth

1. The AEP GitHub repositories are the source of truth for everything in the
   project, including both code and guidelines.

## Article V: Meetings & Voting

1. The steering committee shall hold a regular meeting on a cadence of its
   choosing, and shall keep minutes of said meetings in a GitHub repository set
   aside for that purpose, which shall be accessible by all steering committee
   members.
   1. Meetings and minutes may be public or private, at the discretion of the
      steering committee.
2. The steering committee ordinarily operates by consensus, and recording votes
   for each decision is not required (but the decision should be recorded in
   the minutes). When possible, decisions and voting shall be done using GitHub
   issues for transparency.
3. In the event that a vote is required, an email shall be sent to each
   steering committee explaining the issue in question and allowing at least 10
   business days for voting. The specifics of how elections are handled are at
   the discretion of the steering committee.

## Article VI: Amendment

This charter may be amended by a two-thirds supermajority of the steering
committee, after conducting an vote as described in VÂ§3.
