# Adopting AEPs for your company

By adopting the guidelines from the API Enhancement Proposals, you establish a much 
tighter and efficient possibility space. APIs that follow the 
[AEP guidance](https://aep.dev) from the design stage:

- are more consistent  within and across teams, reducing cognitive load for API consumers
- reduce arguments  about API design decisions, thanks to the AEP specification, tools, and exemplar design patterns

Having an AEP-compliant API also means benefitting from the AEP ecosystem of tooling, such as:

- Linters and validators to ensure adherence to the AEP design specification [proto]()/[openapi]()
- A command line tool interface genreator that make it easier to work with APIs ([aepcli](https://github.com/aep-dev/aepcli))
- Client-side and server-side code generators ([aepc](https://github.com/aep-dev/aepc))
- A Terraform provider ([terraform-provider-aep](https://github.com/aep-dev/terraform-provider-aep))
- ... and more! Please start a [discussion](https://github.com/aep-dev/aep.dev/discussions) if there is something you wish to see, validate, or prioritize.
