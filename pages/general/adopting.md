# Adopting AEPs for your company

Currently, we encourage adoption of AEPs via having your APIs adhere to the
guidance served at https://aep.dev.

In the future, we plan to introduce a broader ecosystem of tooling including:

- A forkable repository which allows for internal mirrors and
  organization-specific guidance.
- Client-side and server-side code generators.
- Validators to ensure adherence to the specification.
