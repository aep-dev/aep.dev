# Resource association

APIs sometimes have resource relationships that can not be cleanly expressed in
a hierarchical structure. For example, a resource may have a many-to-one
relationship with two other resource types instead of just one. Alternatively,
a resource may have a many-to-many relationship with another resource type.

## Guidance

A resource **must** have at most one canonical parent, and `List` requests
**must not** require two distinct "parents".

### Multiple many-to-one associations

If a resource has a many-to-one relationship with multiple resource types, it
**must** choose at most one of them to be the parent. The resource **may** be
associated with other resources through other fields on the resource.

{% tab proto %}

{% sample 'multiple_many_to_one.proto', 'message Book' %}

{% tab oas %}

{% sample 'multiple_many_to_one.oas.yaml', 'Book' %}

{% endtabs %}

When listing resources with multiple associations in this way, the RPC **must**
treat the `string parent` field as required as discussed in [list](/list), and
**must not** add additional required arguments. The RPC **should** include a
`string filter` field that allows users to filter by other resource
associations as discussed in [filtering](/filtering).

**Note:** Resource reference fields **must** accept the
[resource path](/resource-path) of the referenced resource.

### Many-to-many associations

Many-to-many associations are less common in APIs than they are in relational
databases, in part because they are more difficult to model and present over
network interfaces.

An API **may** contain many-to-many relationships, and **should** use a
repeated field containing a list of resource paths, following the principles
described for repeated fields in [arrays][/arrays].

{% tab proto %}

{% sample 'many_to_many_repeated.proto', 'message Book' %}

{% tab oas %}

{% sample 'many_to_many_repeated.oas.yaml', 'Book' %}

{% endtabs %}

**Note:** See [arrays](/arrays) for more information on repeated fields,
including how to handle common issues such as atomic changes.

If the use of a repeated field is too restrictive, or if more metadata is
required along with the association, an API **may** model a many-to-many
relationship using a sub-resource with two one-to-many associations.

{% tab proto %}

{% sample 'many_to_many_subresource.proto', 'message BookAuthor' %}

{% tab oas %}

{% sample 'many_to_many_subresource.oas.yaml', 'BookAuthor' %}

{% endtabs %}

**Note:** Using subresources to model an association between resources is only
recommended if additional metadata is required in the relationship, or if the
restrictions around the use of a repeated field preclude the use of that
approach.

### Embedded resources

Resource references as described use string references rather than embedding
one resource inside another because embedding resources can lead to a number of
issues. Retrieving resources with arbitrarily deep nesting may require multiple
serial internal RPCs, leading to complex service dependencies latency and
reliability issues.

However, sometimes dereferencing resource references is useful, or even
necessary. For example, an API may wish to allow filtering of a resource based
on a field of a resource it references. In other cases, it may be much cheaper
and/or faster for the server to perform the dereferencing than for the client
to make multiple serial requests.

In these cases, an alternative resource association pattern **may** be used,
where the resource reference field is not a string, but is instead the
referenced resource itself.

The default behavior **should** be to populate only the `path` field of the
referenced resource, making it equivalent to a string-based resource reference.
Additional fields **may** be included based on the request: for example, if the
request includes a [view or read mask](./partial-responses) that specifies that
additional fields should be included, or if the request contains a filter that
specifies fields other than `path` within the referenced resource.

APIs **must** always fully document their behavior with embedded resources,
even if the only supported behavior is populating only the `path` field. If the
referenced resource itself contains embedded resources, the API **must**
include clear documentation about the depth to which embedded resources may be
dereferenced.

**Note:** There is no need for the _referenced_ resource to define a
`PATH_ONLY` [view](./partial-responses) corresponding to the default behavior
of populating only the `path` field. This is because a resource should not have
to define a view enum simply because another resource references it.
