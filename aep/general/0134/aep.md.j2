# Update

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `PATCH` or `PUT` request to a
resource's URI (for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in
order to update that resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AeP-121][]) honors this pattern through the `Update`
method (which mirrors the REST `PATCH` behavior). These RPCs accept the URI
representing that resource and return the resource.

## Guidance

APIs **should** provide an update method for resources unless it is not
valuable for users to do so. The purpose of the update method is to make
changes to the resources without causing side effects.

Update methods are specified using the following pattern:

{% tab proto %}

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Update`. The remainder of the
  RPC name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** exactly match the RPC name, with a `Request`
  suffix.
- The response message **must** be the resource itself.
  - The response **should** include the fully-populated resource, and **must**
    include any fields that were sent and included in the update mask unless
    they are input only (see AEP-203).
  - If the update RPC is [long-running](#long-running-update), the response
    message **must** be an `Operation` for which the return type is the
    resource itself.
- The method **should** support partial resource update, and the HTTP verb
  **should** be `PATCH`.

```proto
rpc UpdateBook(UpdateBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    patch: "/v1/{book.path=publishers/*/books/*}"
    body: "book"
  };
  option (google.api.method_signature) = "book,update_mask";
}
```

- The resource's `path` field **should** map to the URI path.
  - The `{resource}.path` field **should** be the only variable in the URI
    path.
- There **must** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation, and it
  **must** map to the resource field in the request message.
  - All remaining fields **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
  with a value of `"{resource},update_mask"`.

**Note:** Unlike the other four standard methods, the URI path here references
a nested field (`book.path`) in the example. If the resource field has a word
separator, `snake_case` is used.

### Request message

Update methods implement a common request message pattern:

- The request message **must** contain a field for the resource.
  - The name of this field **must** be the singular form of the resource's
    name.
- The request message **must not** contain any required fields other than those
  described in this section, and **should not** contain other optional fields
  except those described in this or another AEP.

{% tab proto %}

```proto
message UpdateBookRequest {
  // The book to update.
  //
  // The book's `path` field is used to identify the book to update.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  Book book = 1 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];

  // The list of fields to update.
  google.protobuf.FieldMask update_mask = 2;
}
```

- The request message field for the resource **must** map to the `PATCH` body.
- The request message field for the resource **should** be [annotated as
  required][aep-203].
  - A `path` field **must** be included in the resource message. It **should**
    be called `path`.
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aep-123] of the resource
    being updated.
- If partial resource update is supported, a field mask **must** be included.
  It **must** be of type `google.protobuf.FieldMask`, and it **must** be called
  `update_mask`.
  - The fields used in the field mask correspond to the resource being updated
    (not the request message).
  - The field **may** be required or optional. If it is required, it **must**
    include the corresponding annotation. If optional, the service **must**
    treat an omitted field mask as an implied field mask equivalent to all
    fields that are populated (have a non-empty value).
  - Update masks **must** support a special value `*`, meaning full replacement
    (the equivalent of `PUT`).

### Side effects

In general, update methods are intended to update the data within the resource.
Update methods **should not** trigger other side effects. Instead, side effects
**should** be triggered by custom methods.

In particular, this entails that [state fields][] **must not** be directly
writable in update methods.

### PATCH and PUT

**TL;DR:** AEP-compliant APIs generally use the `PATCH` HTTP verb only, and do
not support `PUT` requests.

We standardize on `PATCH` because many organizations update stable APIs in
place with backwards-compatible improvements. It is often necessary to add a
new field to an existing resource, but this becomes a breaking change when
using `PUT`.

To illustrate this, consider a `PUT` request to a `Book` resource:

    PUT /v1/publishers/123/books/456

    {"title": "Mary Poppins", "author": "P.L. Travers"}

Next consider that the resource is later augmented with a new field (here we
add `rating`, and use a protobuf example without loss of generality):

```proto
message Book {
  string title = 1;
  string author = 2;

  // Subsequently added to v1 in place...
  int32 rating = 3;
}
```

If a rating were set on a book and the existing `PUT` request were executed, it
would wipe out the book's rating. In essence, a `PUT` request unintentionally
would wipe out data because the previous version did not know about it.

### Create or update

If the service uses client-assigned resource paths, `Update` methods **may**
expose a `bool allow_missing` field, which will cause the method to succeed in
the event that the user attempts to update a resource that is not present (and
will create the resource in the process):

{% tab proto %}

```proto
message UpdateBookRequest {
  // The book to update.
  //
  // The book's `path` field is used to identify the book to be updated.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  Book book = 1 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];

  // The list of fields to be updated.
  google.protobuf.FieldMask update_mask = 2;

  // If set to true, and the book is not found, a new book will be created.
  // In this situation, `update_mask` is ignored.
  bool allow_missing = 3;
}
```

{% tab oas %}

**Note:** OAS example not yet written.

{% endtabs %}

More specifically, the `allow_missing` flag triggers the following behavior:

- If the method call is on a resource that does not exist, the resource is
  created. All fields are applied regardless of any provided field mask.
  - However, if any required fields are missing or fields have invalid values,
    an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
- If the method call is on a resource that already exists, and all fields
  match, the existing resource is returned unchanged.
- If the method call is on a resource that already exists, only fields declared
  in the field mask are updated.

The user **must** have the update permissions to call `Update` even with
`allow_missing` set to `true`.

### Etags

An API may sometimes need to allow users to send update requests which are
guaranteed to be made against the most current data (a common use case for this
is to detect and avoid race conditions). Resources which need to enable this do
so by including a `string etag` field, which contains an opaque,
server-computed value representing the content of the resource.

In this situation, the resource **should** contain a `string etag` field:

{% tab proto %}

```proto
message Book {
  option (google.api.resource) = {
    type: "library.example.com/Book"
    pattern: "publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}"
  };

  // The resource path of the book.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  string path = 1 [(google.api.field_behavior) = IDENTIFIER];

  // The title of the book.
  // Example: "Mary Poppins"
  string title = 2;

  // The author of the book.
  // Example: "P.L. Travers"
  string author = 3;

  // The etag for this book.
  // If this is provided on update, it must match the server's etag.
  string etag = 4;
}
```

{% tab oas %}

**Note:** OAS example not yet written.

{% endtabs %}

The `etag` field **may** be either [required][] or [optional][]. If it is set,
then the request **must** succeed if and only if the provided etag matches the
server-computed value, and **must** fail with an `ABORTED` error otherwise. The
`update_mask` field in the request does not affect the behavior of the `etag`
field, as it is not a field _being_ updated.

### Expensive fields

APIs sometimes encounter situations where some fields on a resource are
expensive or impossible to reliably return.

This can happen in a few situations:

- A resource may have some fields that are very expensive to compute, and that
  are generally not useful to the customer on update requests.
- A single resource sometimes represents an amalgamation of data from multiple
  underlying (and eventually consistent) data sources. In these situations, it
  may be infeasible to return authoritative information on the fields that were
  not changed.

In this situation, an API **may** return back only the fields that were updated
and omit the rest. APIs that do this **must** document this behavior.

### Errors

See [errors][], in particular [when to use PERMISSION_DENIED and NOT_FOUND
errors][permission-denied].

In addition, if the user does have proper permission, but the requested
resource does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404)
unless `allow_missing` is set to `true`.
