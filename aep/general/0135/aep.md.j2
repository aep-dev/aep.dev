# Delete

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `DELETE` request to a resource's URI
(for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in order to delete
that resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AEP-121][aep-121]) honors this pattern through the
`Delete` method. This method accepts the URI representing that resource and
usually returns an empty response.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a delete method for resources unless it is
not valuable for users to do so.

The Delete method **should** succeed if and only if a resource was present and
was successfully deleted. If the resource did not exist, the method **should**
send a `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`) error.

The method **must** have [strong consistency][]: the completion of a delete
method **must** mean that the existence of the resource has reached a
steady-state and reading resource state returns a consistent `404 Not found`
(`NOT_FOUND`) response.

### Operation

Delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'message DeleteBookRequest' %}

- The method's name **must** begin with the word `Delete`. The remainder of the
  method name **should** be the singular form of the resource's name.
- The request schema name **must** exactly match the method name, with a
  `Request` suffix.
- The request message field receiving the resource path **should** map to the
  URI path.
  - This field **should** be called `path`.
  - The `path` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
    remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
  with a value of `"path"`. If an etag or force field are used, they **may** be
  included in the signature.

{% tab oas %}

```http
DELETE /v1/publishers/{publisher}/book/{book} HTTP/2
Host: bookstore.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

- The response body **should** be omitted.
- The HTTP response code **should** be `204 No Content` if the delete was
  successful.

{% endtabs %}

### Requests

Delete methods implement a common request pattern:

- The HTTP verb **must** be `DELETE`.
- If a delete request contains a body, the body **must** be ignored, and **must
  not** cause an error (this is required by [RFC 9110][])
- The request **must not** require any fields in the query string. The request
  **should not** include optional fields in the query string unless described
  in another AEP.

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'message DeleteBookRequest' %}

- A `path` field **must** be included. It **should** be called `path`.
  - The field **should** be [annotated as required][aep-203].
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aep-4] that it
    references.
- The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AEP.

{% tab oas %}

{% sample '../example.oas.yaml', '$.paths./publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}.delete.parameters' %}

{% endtabs %}

### Responses

{% tab proto %}

- The response message **should** be `google.protobuf.Empty`.

{% tab oas %}

{% sample '../example.oas.yaml', '$.paths./publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}.delete.responses.200' %}

- Delete methods **should** return `204 No Content` with no response body.

{% endtabs %}

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with `403 Forbidden`
(`PERMISSION_DENIED`). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the
resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist, the service **must** error with `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`).

### Soft delete

**Note:** This material was moved into its own document to provide a more
comprehensive treatment: [AEP-164][aep-164].

### Cascading delete

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to be able to delete a resource as
well as all applicable child resources. However, since deletion is usually
permanent, it is also important that users not do so accidentally, as
reconstructing wiped-out child resources may be quite difficult.

If an API allows deletion of a resource that may have child resources, the API
**must** provide a `bool force` field on the request, which the user sets to
explicitly opt in to a cascading delete.

{% tab proto -%}

```proto
message DeletePublisherRequest {
  // The path of the publisher to delete.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  string path = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library.example.com/Publisher"
    }];

  // If set to true, any books from this publisher will also be deleted.
  // (Otherwise, the request will only work if the publisher has no books.)
  bool force = 2;
}
```

The API **must** fail with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error if the `force` field
is `false` (or unset) and child resources are present.

{% tab oas -%}

{% sample 'cascading_delete.oas.yaml', '$.paths' %}

The API **must** fail with a `409 Conflict` error if the `force` field is
`false` (or unset) and child resources are present.

{% endtabs %}

## Interface Definitions

{% endtabs %}
