# Delete

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `DELETE` request to a resource's URI
(for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in order to delete
that resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AEP-121][aep-121]) honors this pattern through the
`Delete` method. This method accepts the URI representing that resource and
usually returns an empty response.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a delete method for resources unless it is
not valuable for users to do so.

The Delete method **should** succeed if and only if a resource was present and
was successfully deleted. If the resource did not exist, the method **should**
send a `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`) error.

### Requests

{% tab oas -%}

Delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

{% sample 'delete.oas.yaml', 'paths' %}

- The HTTP verb **must** be `DELETE`.
- There **must not** be a request body in API description.
- If a delete request contains a body, the body **must** be ignored, and **must
  not** cause an error (this is required by [RFC 9110][])
- The request **must not** require any fields in the query string. The request
  **should not** include optional fields in the query string unless described
  in another AEP.
- Delete methods **should** return `204 No Content` with no response body, or
  `202 Accepted` with a representation of the operation in the response body
  if the delete is [long-running](#long-running-delete).
- If the API is operating on the [Management Plane][], the method should have
  [strong consistency][]: the completion of a delete method **must** mean that
  the existence of the resource has reached a steady-state and reading resource
  state returns a consistent `404 Not found`response.

{% tab proto -%}

Delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc DeleteBook(DeleteBookRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    delete: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*}"
  };
  option (google.api.method_signature) = "name";
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Delete`. The remainder of the
  RPC name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `Request` suffix.
- The response message **should** be `google.protobuf.Empty`.
  - If the delete RPC is [long-running](#long-running-delete), the response
    message **must** be a `library.longrunning.Operation` which resolves to the
    correct response.
- The request message field receiving the resource name **should** map to the
  URI path.
  - This field **should** be called `name`.
  - The `name` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
    remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
  with a value of `"name"`. If an etag or force field are used, they **may** be
  included in the signature.
- If the API is operating on the [Management Plane][], the method should have
  [strong consistency][]: the completion of a delete method **must** mean that
  the existence of the resource has reached a steady-state and reading resource
  state returns a consistent `NOT_FOUND` response.

Delete methods implement a common request pattern:

```proto
message DeleteBookRequest {
  // The path of the book to delete.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  string path = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library.example.com/Book"
    }];
}
```

- A `path` field **must** be included. It **should** be called `path`.
  - The field **should** be [annotated as required][aep-203].
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aep-123] that it
    references.
- The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AEP.

{% endtabs %}

### Soft delete

**Note:** This material was moved into its own document to provide a more
comprehensive treatment: [AEP-164][aep-164].

### Long-running delete

Some resources take longer to delete than is reasonable for a regular API
request. In this situation, the API **should** use a long-running operation
instead: [AEP-151][aep-151].

{% tab oas -%}

{% sample 'long_running_delete.oas.yaml', 'paths' %}

- The response status code should be `202 Accepted` if the request was accepted
  for later processing. When the request is processed it could still fail.
- The `response` field of the response body **must** be an empty object to be
  consistent with the appropriate return type if the method was not
  long-running.
- Both the `response_type` and `metadata_type` fields **must** be specified.

{% tab proto -%}

```proto
rpc DeleteBook(DeleteBookRequest) returns (library.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    delete: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*}"
  };
  option (library.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "google.protobuf.Empty"
    metadata_type: "OperationMetadata"
  };
}
```

- The `response` field of the response **must** be `google.protobuf.Empty` to
  be consistent with the appropriate return type if the method was not
  long-running.
- Both the `response_type` and `metadata_type` fields **must** be specified
  (even if they are `google.protobuf.Empty`).

{% endtabs %}

### Cascading delete

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to be able to delete a resource as
well as all applicable child resources. However, since deletion is usually
permanent, it is also important that users not do so accidentally, as
reconstructing wiped-out child resources may be quite difficult.

If an API allows deletion of a resource that may have child resources, the API
**must** provide a `bool force` field on the request, which the user sets to
explicitly opt in to a cascading delete.

{% tab oas -%}

{% sample 'cascading_delete.oas.yaml', 'paths' %}

The API **must** fail with a `409 Conflict` error if the `force` field is
`false` (or unset) and child resources are present.

{% tab proto -%}

```proto
message DeletePublisherRequest {
  // The name of the publisher to delete.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  string name = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library.example.com/Publisher"
    }];

  // If set to true, any books from this publisher will also be deleted.
  // (Otherwise, the request will only work if the publisher has no books.)
  bool force = 2;
}
```

The API **must** fail with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error if the `force` field
is `false` (or unset) and child resources are present.

{% endtabs %}

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with `403 Forbidden`
(`PERMISSION_DENIED`). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the
resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist, the service **must** error with `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`).
