# AEP Style and Guidance

AEP stands for **API Enhancement Proposal**, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API design and development. The
goal is for these documents to serve as the source of truth for API-related
documentation and the way API teams discuss and come to consensus on API
guidance.

AEPs are most useful when they are clear and concise, and cover a single topic
or inquiry well. In the same way that AEPs describe consistent patterns and
style for use in APIs, they also _follow_ consistent patterns and style.

## Guidance

- AEPs **must** cover a single, discrete topic, and provide clear, actionable
  guidance.
- AEPs **must not** duplicate or contradict guidance in another AEP.
- AEPs **may** also cover what _not_ to do, but **should not** cover _only_
  anti-patterns.
- If AEP guidance is conditional (e.g. a design pattern such as Jobs), the
  guidance **must** clearly explain under what conditions the guidance should
  be followed.

Guidance contained within an AEP **must** be beneficial to one or more types of
clients or their authors, including but not limited to:

- Asset inventories which can be used to audit and analyze resources.
- Command line interfaces for exploration and simple automation.
- Custom controllers (e.g. auto-scalers) which poll live state and adjust
  resource configuration accordingly.
- [Declarative clients][] for orchestration and automation of multiple resources.
- Recommendation tools which provide guidance on which APIs are useful for
  specific use cases, and how to use them.
- SDKs to interact with an API from a programming language, often used heavily
  for data-plane operations.
- Security orchestration, automation, and remediation tools.
- Simple scripts to automate or orchestrate tasks.
- Test frameworks.
- Tools that operate on resource data at rest.
- Visual User Interfaces for visualization and one-off manual actions.
- Users.

Examples of enhancements include:

- Requiring new proto annotations that enable more descriptive interfaces on
  clients (e.g. requiring `singular` and `plural` on a `google.api.resource`
  annotation).

AEP guidance **must not** be a significant detriment to a client's usability or
implementation difficulty, or maintenance difficulty.

Examples of detriments include:

- Introduction of a non-uniform pattern in a standard method such that all
  clients must introduce additional code without sufficient benefit (e.g. List
  behaves like this _except_ for resources that start with the name Foo).
- Renames of well-established fields for minor enhancements in readability
  (e.g. rename `expire_time` to `lapse_time` since `lapse` is a common term in
  my service).

While the length of AEPs will necessarily vary based on the complexity of the
question, most AEPs **should** be able to cover their content in roughly two
printed pages.

### File structure

AEPs **must** be written in Markdown, and **must** be named using their
four-digit number (example: `0008.md`). AEPs that serve a specific scope
**must** be in the subdirectory for that scope.

AEPs **must** have appropriate front matter.

```yaml
---
id: 8
state: reviewing
created: 2019-05-28
permalink: /8
redirect_from:
  - /08
  - /008
  - /0008
---
```

Front matter for AEPs **must** include:

- The `aep` key:
  - `id`: Required. The ID for the given AEP, as an integer.
  - `state`: Required. The current state of the AEP, in all lower-case. The
    valid states are listed in [AEP-1][], and common states are `draft`,
    `reviewing`, and `approved`.
  - `created`: Required. The ISO-8601 date (`yyyy-mm-dd`) when the AEP was
    originally drafted, with no quotes.
  - `updated`: The ISO-8601 date (`yyyy-mm-dd`) when the AEP was last revised.
  - `scope`: The scope for the AEP. This **must** match the directory name for
    that scope. Required for AEPs with IDs >= 1000, prohibited otherwise.
- The `permalink` key (required): This **must** be set to
  `/{aep.scope}/{aep.id}`. If there is no scope, use `/{aep.id}` instead.
- The `redirect_from` key: This should include a list of any `/{aep.id}`
  permutations that a reader would be likely to enter, including:
  - `/{aep.id}` (for AEPs where the permalink includes the scope)
  - AEP IDs with zero-padding, for each level of zero-padding up to four digits
    (for example: `/08`, `/008`, `/0008`).

### Document structure

AEPs **must** begin with a top-level heading with the AEP's title (`# Title`).
The title **should** be a noun (not an imperative). For example, "Bad API
precedents" not "Avoid breaking API precedent".

AEPs **should** then begin with an introduction (with no additional heading),
followed by a `## Guidance` heading. If necessary, the AEP **may** include any
of the following after the guidance, in the following order:

- "Further reading" is a bulleted list of links to other AEPs that are useful
  to fully understand the current AEP.
- "Appendices" covering further explanation in the same AEP. These are
  relatively rare but are important in cases where an AEP requires a lot of
  justification for the decision. Often this is primarily an explanation of
  alternatives considered to help explain the guidance.
- "Changelog" is a bulleted list of changes made to the AEP since the first
  writing.

The guidance section **may** include subsections that elaborate further on
details. Subsections will automatically create an entry in the table of
contents, and an anchor for citations.

Below is an example AEP shell that uses each major section:

```md
# AEP title

The introductory text explains the background and reason why the AEP exists. It
lays out the basic question, but does not tell the reader what to do.

## Guidance

The "guidance" section helps the reader know what to do. A common format for
the guidance section is a high-level imperative, followed by an example,
followed by a bulleted list explaining the example.

### Subsection

Individual subsections can be cited individually, and further elaborate
details.

## Rationale

The "rationale" section is optional, and helps the reader understand the
motivation behind specific guidance within the AEP.

Deeper explanations of design justification and tradeoffs **must** be in the
rationale instead of other sections, to ensure the rest of the document acts as
an easily actionable reference.

## History

The "history" section is optional, and documents events and context around a
significant edit to an AEP. For example, explanation of rewrite would be
included in this section

While the changelog is a dotted list of one-line summaries of changes to an
AEP, the history section should elaborate on significant events in a
descriptive format.

The section **must not** be used to exhaustively enumerate all changes. This is
what the changelog provides.

## Further reading

A bulleted list of (usually) other AEPs, in the following format:

- [AEP-1](./0001.md): AEP purpose and guidelines

## Changelog

A bulleted list of changes in reverse chronological order, using the following
format:

- **2020-02-18**: Specified ordering.
- **2019-07-01**: Added a subsection clarifying XYZ.
```

AEPs **should** attempt to follow this overall format if possible, but AEPs
**may** deviate from it if necessary (in particular, if the AEP would be more
difficult to understand, even for a reader already accustomed to reading AEPs
in the usual format).

**Note:** Except for the title, AEPs **must** only use the second heading level
(`##`) and above. AEPs **should** only use the second and third heading levels
(`##`, `###`).

### Requirement keywords

AEPs **should** use the following requirement level keywords: "MUST", "MUST
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY", which are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC 2119][].

When using these terms in AEPs, they **must** be lower-case and **bold**. These
terms **should not** be used in other ways.

If "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" are used, they **must** include valid examples of
where other concerns may override the guidance.

**Important:** If rationale is used, it exists to provide background and a more
complete understanding, but **must not** contain guidance (and RFC-2119 terms
**must not** be used).

### Code examples

API design examples in AEPs **should** be presented in both [OpenAPI][] and
[protocol buffers][]. Examples **should** cover only enough syntax to explain
the concept. When using RPCs in examples, a `google.api.http` annotation
**should** be included.

AEPs should use snake-case naming for parameters and properties (fields), for
consistency across OpenAPI and protocol buffers, but other casing conventions
may be used as long as they are applied uniformly.

### Referencing AEPs

When AEPs reference other AEPs, the prosaic text **must** use the format
`AEP-XXXX` without zero-padding (e.g., `AEP-8`, not `AEP-0008`), and **must**
link to the relevant AEP. AEP links **may** point to a particular section of
the AEP if appropriate.

**Important:** AEP links **must** use the relative path to the file in the
repository (such as `./0008.md` for core AEPs, or `../0008.md` for AEPs in a
subdirectory); this ensures that the link works both on the AEP site, when
viewing the Markdown file on GitHub, using the local development server, or a
branch.

### Error codes

When referencing a error code, the prose **should** use the format `{google.api.error_code} / {http_status_code}`. For example, `OK / 200`.

## Rationale

### Designing for a broad set of clients

API guidance, similar to any software, is most beneficial when there is a clear
purpose and target beneficiary.

The beneficiaries of improved API design are users. These users interact with
APIs via a variety of clients, depending on their use case as enumerated above.

API guidance must in turn consider the impact broadly across these clients.
