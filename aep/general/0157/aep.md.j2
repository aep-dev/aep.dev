# Partial responses

Sometimes, a resource can be either large or expensive to compute, and the API
needs to give the user control over which fields it sends back.

## Guidance

APIs **may** support partial responses in one of two ways:

### `read_mask` parameter

Field masks can be used for granting the user fine-grained control over what
fields are returned. An API **should** support the mask as a request field
named `read_mask`.

- The field mask parameter **must** be optional:
  - An explicit value of `"*"` **should** be supported, and **must** return all
    fields.
  - If the field mask parameter is omitted, it **must** default to `"*"`,
    unless otherwise documented.
- An API **may** allow read masks with non-terminal repeated fields (unlike
  update masks), but is not obligated to do so.

**Note:** Changing the default value of the field mask parameter is a
[breaking change](./backwards-compatibility#semantic-changes).

{% tab proto %}

- The value of the field mask parameter **must** be a
  `google.protobuf.FieldMask`.

  **Warning:** There is a known conflict between the guidance about
  non-terminal repeated fields guidance and the documentation of `FieldMask`
  itself:
  [google/protobuf/field_mask.proto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/5e84a6169cf0f9716c9285c95c860bcb355dbdc1/src/google/protobuf/field_mask.proto#L85-L86)
  states that
  `A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a paths string.`
  As such, official libraries (such as `Merge` for FieldMasks) may not support
  wildcards without additional work. Track the issue
  [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8547#issuecomment-2005180068).
  Consider using the view enumeration pattern described below instead instead.

### View enumeration

Alternatively, an API **may** support partial responses with view enums. View
enums are useful for situations where an API only wants to expose a small
number of permutations to the user:

- The enum **should** be specified as a `view` field on the request message.
- The enum **should** be named something ending in `-View`
- The enum **should** at minimum have values named `BASIC` and `FULL` (although
  it **may** have values other than these).
- The `UNSPECIFIED` value **must** be valid (not an error), and the API
  **must** document what the unspecified value will do.
  - For List methods, the effective default value **should** be `BASIC`.
  - For Get methods, the effective default value **should** be either `BASIC`
    or `FULL`.
- APIs **may** add fields to a given view over time. APIs **must not** remove a
  field from a given view (this is a breaking change).

  **Note:** If a service requires (or might require) multiple views with
  overlapping but distinct values, there is a potential for a namespace
  conflict. In this situation, the service **should** nest the view enum within
  the individual resource.

**Note:** The implicit `PATH_ONLY` view described by
[resource association via embedded resources](.association/#embedded-resources)
**should not** be explicitly defined in the view enum.

{% tab proto %}

```proto
enum BookView {
  // The default / unset value.
  // The API will default to the BASIC view.
  BOOK_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED = 0;

  // Include basic metadata about the book, but not the full contents.
  // This is the default value (for both ListBooks and GetBook).
  BOOK_VIEW_BASIC = 1;

  // Include everything.
  BOOK_VIEW_FULL = 2;
}
```

- The enum **should** be defined at the top level of the proto file (as it is
  likely to be needed in multiple requests, e.g. both `Get` and `List`). See
  [enumerations](./enumerations) for more guidance on top-level enumerations.
