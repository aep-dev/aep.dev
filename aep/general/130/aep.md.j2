# Methods

An API is composed of one or more methods, which represent a specific operation
that a service can perform on behalf of the consumer.

### Categories of Methods

The following enumerates multiple categories of methods that exist, often
grouped up under some object (e.g. collection or resource) that the method
operates upon.

### Choosing a method category

While designing a method, API authors should choose from the defined categories
in the following order:

1. Standard methods (on collections and resources)
1. Standard batch or aggregate methods
1. Custom methods (on collections, resources, or stateless)
1. Streaming methods

## Rationale

Resource-oriented standard and custom methods are recommended first, as they can
be expressed in the widest variety of clients (Declarative clients, CLIs, UIs, and so on), and
offer the most uniform experience that allows users to apply their knowledge of
one API to another.

If a standard method is unsuitable, then custom methods (that are mounted to a
resource or collection) offer a lesser, but still valuable level of consistency,
helping the user reason about the scope of the action and the object whose
configuration is read to inform that action. Although mutative custom methods
are not uniform enough to have an automated integration with exclusively
resource-oriented clients such as [Declarative clients][], they are still a pattern that
can be easily recognized by CLIs, UIs, and SDKs.

If one cannot express their APIs in a resource-oriented fashion at all, then the
operation falls in a category where the lack of uniformity makes it difficult
for any client aside from SDKs to model the operation. This category is
preferred last due to the fact that a user cannot rely on their knowledge of
similar APIs, as well as the issue that integration with many clients will
likely have to be hand-written.
