# Enumerations

It is common for a field to only accept or provide a discrete and limited set
of values. In these cases, it can be useful to use enumerations (generally
abbreviated "enums") in order to clearly communicate what the set of allowed
values are.

## Guidance

APIs **may** expose enum objects for sets of values that are expected to change
infrequently:

```typescript
// Possible formats in which a book may be published.
enum Format {
  // The printed format, in hardback.
  Hardback = 'HARDBACK',

  // The printed format, in paperback.
  Paperback = 'PAPERBACK',

  // An electronic book format.
  Ebook = 'EBOOK',

  // An audio recording.
  Audiobook = 'AUDIOBOOK',
}
```

- All enum values **should** use a consistent case format across an
  organization. In many cases, this is dictated by the IDL the organization
  uses.
- Enums **should** document whether the enum is frozen or they expect to add
  values in the future.

### When to use enums

Enums can be more accessible and readable than strings or booleans in many
cases, but they do add overhead when they change. Therefore, enums **should**
receive new values infrequently. While the definition of "infrequently" may
change based on individual use cases, a good rule of thumb is no more than once
a year. For enums that change frequently, the API **should** use a string and
document the format.

**Note:** If an enumerated value needs to be shared across APIs, an enum
**may** be used, but the assignment between enum values and their wire
representation **must** match.

### Alternatives

Enums **should not** be used when there is a competing, widely-adopted standard
representation (such as with [language codes][bcp-47] or [media types][]).
Instead, that standard representation **should** be used. This is true even if
only a small subset of values are permitted, because using enums in this
situation often leads to frustrating lookup tables when trying to use multiple
APIs together.

For enumerated values where the set of allowed values changes frequently, APIs
**should** use a `string` field instead, and **must** document the allowed
values. String fields with enumerated values **should** use a uniform case
system (`snake_case`, `kebab-case`, etc.) throughout an organization.

Boolean fields **may** be used in situations where it is clear that no further
flexibility will be needed. The default value **must** be `false`.

### Compatibility

Adding values to an enum has the potential to be disruptive to existing
clients. Consider code written against the `Format` enum in an earlier version
where only the first two options were available:

```typescript
switch (book.format) {
  case Format.Hardback:
    // Do something...
    break;
  case Format.Paperback:
    // Do something...
    break;
  default:
    // When new enum values are introduced, pre-existing client code may
    // throw errors or act in unexpected ways.
    throw new Error('Unrecognized value.');
}
```

Services **may** add new values to existing enums; however, they **should** add
enums carefully; think about what will happen if a client system does not know
about a new value.

Additionally, in IDLs where enum values are presented in a specific order,
services **should** only add new values to the end. An exception to this rule
is if the enum conforms to an external standard (for example, an enum
representing HTTP status codes would add a new 3xx value alongside the others,
not at the end).

## Interface Definitions

{% tab proto %}

{% sample 'enum.proto', 'enum Format' %}

- The zero value of the enum **should** be the name of the enum itself followed
  by the suffix `_UNSPECIFIED`. The service **may** either allow or prohibit
  use of this value.
- Enums which will only be used in a single message **should** be nested within
  that message. In this case, the enum **should** be declared immediately
  before it is used.
- If multiple enums are in the same namespace, they **must not** share any
  values. (This is because enums do not provide their own namespace for their
  values in some languages.)
- If an enumerated value needs to be shared across APIs, an enum **may** be
  used, but the assignment between the value names and the tag numbers **must**
  match.

**Note:** When using protocol buffers, it is impossible to distinguish between
`false` and unset. If this is a requirement, an enum **may** be a better design
choice (although `google.protobuf.BoolValue` is also available).

{% tab oas %}

{% sample 'enum.oas.yaml', 'format' %}

- Enumerated fields **should** be strings.
- If the enum is optional, The `null` value **should** be used as the empty
  value, and **should** be the first value specified.

**Note:** If `null` is a valid value, OpenAPI 3.0 also requires that
`nullable: true` is specified for the field.
