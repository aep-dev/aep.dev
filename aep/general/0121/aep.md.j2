# Resource-oriented design

Resource-oriented design is a pattern for specifying [RPC][] APIs, based on the
following high-level design principles:

- The fundamental building blocks of an API are individually-named _resources_
  (nouns) and the relationships and hierarchy that exist between them.
- A small number of standard _methods_ (verbs) provide the semantics for most
  common operations. However, custom methods are available in situations where
  the standard methods do not fit.

Readers might notice similarities between these principles and some principles
of [REST][]; resource-oriented design borrows many principles from REST, while
also defining its own patterns where appropriate.

## Guidance

When designing an API, consider the following:

- The resources (nouns) the API will provide.
- The relationships and hierarchies between those resources.
- The schema of each resource.
- The methods (verbs) each resource provides, relying as much as possible on
  the standard verbs.

### Resources

A resource-oriented API **must** be modeled as a resource hierarchy, where each
node is either a simple resource or a collection of resources.

A _collection_ contains resources of _the same type_. For example, a publisher
has the collection of books that it publishes. A resource usually has fields,
and resources may have any number of sub-resources (usually collections).

**Note:** While there is some conceptual alignment between storage systems and
APIs, a service with a resource-oriented API is not necessarily a database, and
has enormous flexibility in how it interprets resources and methods. API
designers **should not** expect that their API will be reflective of their
database schema. In fact, having an API that is identical to the underlying
database schema is actually an anti-pattern, as it tightly couples the surface
to the underlying system.

### Methods

Resource-oriented APIs emphasize resources (data model) over the methods
performed on those resources (functionality). A typical resource-oriented API
exposes a large number of resources with a small number of methods on each
resource. The methods can be either the standard methods ([Get][], [List][],
[Create][], [Update][], [Delete][]), or [custom methods][].

If the request to or the response from a standard method (or a custom method in
the same _service_) **is** the resource or **contains** the resource, the
resource schema for that resource across all methods **must** be the same.

| Standard method | Request               | Response        |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Create          | Contains the resource | Is the resource |
| Get             | None                  | Is the resource |
| Update          | Contains the resource | Is the resource |
| Delete          | None                  | None            |
| List            | None                  | Is the resource |

_The table above describes each standard method's relationship to the resource,
where "None" indicates that the resource neither **is** nor **is contained** in
the request or the response_

A resource **must** support at minimum [Get][]: clients must be able to
validate the state of resources after performing a mutation such as [Create][],
[Update][], or [Delete][].

A resource **must** also support [List][], except for [singleton resources][]
where more than one resource is not possible.

**Note:** A custom method in resource-oriented design does _not_ entail
defining a new or custom HTTP verb. Custom methods use traditional HTTP verbs
(usually `POST`) and define the custom verb in the URI.

APIs **should** prefer standard methods over custom methods; the purpose of
custom methods is to define functionality that does not cleanly map to any of
the standard methods. Custom methods offer the same design freedom as
traditional RPC APIs, which can be used to implement common programming
patterns, such as database transactions, import and export, or data analysis.

### Strong Consistency

An operation is strongly consistent if the completion of that operation (either
successful or with an error, [long-running][long-running-requests] or
synchronous) **must** mean that the state of the resource's existence and all
user-settable values have reached a steady-state.

[Output only][output only] fields unrelated to the resource [state][]
**should** also have reached a steady-state. Exceptional cases include:

- An output-only field that takes so long to reach a steady-state that it would
  negatively impact the user experience of the request (e.g. an hour-long instantiation
  of a VM cluster).

Examples of strong consistency include:

- Following a successful create that is is latest mutation on a resource, a get
  request for a resource **must** return the resource.
- Following a successful update that is the latest mutation on a resource, a
  get request for a resource **must** return the final values from the update
  request.
- Following a successful delete that is the latest mutation on a resource, a
  get request for a resource **must** return `NOT_FOUND` (or the resource with
  the `DELETED` state value in the case of [soft delete][])

Clients of resource-oriented APIs often need to orchestrate multiple operations
in sequence (e.g. create resource A, create resource B which depends on A), and
ensuring that resources immediately reflect steady user state after an
operation is complete ensures clients can rely on method completion as a signal
to begin the next operation.

[output only][] fields ideally would follow the same guidelines, but as these
fields can often represent a resources live state, it's sometimes necessary for
these values to change after a successful mutation operation to reflect a state
change.

### Cyclic References

The relationship between resources, such as parent-child or [resource
references][], **must** be representable via a [directed acyclic graph][].

A cyclic relationship between resources increases the complexity of managing
resources. Consider resources A and B that refer to each other. The process to
create said resources are:

1. create resource A without a reference to B. Retrieve id for resource A.
2. create resource B with a reference to A. Retrieve id for resource B.
3. update resource A with the reference to B.

The delete operation may also become more complex, due to reasoning about which
resource must be dereferenced first for a successful deletion.

This requirement does not apply to relationships that are expressed via [output
only][] fields, as they do not require the user to specify the values and in
turn do not increase resource management complexity.
