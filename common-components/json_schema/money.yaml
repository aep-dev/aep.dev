    description: |
      A currency code.

      This may be a three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217.

      APIs may define additional currency codes that are not included in the ISO
      4217 standard (for example, virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies). These
      must start with "X-", in order to distinguish them from potential future
      ISO 4217 codes.

      Examples:
        "USD"  - ISO 4217 code for United States dollar.
        "X-BTC" - Potential API-defined extension for Bitcoin.
        "X-RBX" - Potential API-defined extension for the virtual currency Robux.
