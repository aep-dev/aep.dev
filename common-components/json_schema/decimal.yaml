title: Decimal
description: |
  Represents a decimal number in a form similar to scientific notation.

  Examples:
  17            === {"significand": 17,   "exponent": 0}
  -0.005        === {"significand": -5,   "exponent": -3}
  33.5 million  === {"significand": 335,  "exponent": 5}
  11/8 (1.375)  === {"significand": 1375, "exponent": -3}

  Note that the range of a Decmial exceeds that of a JSON `number` (double),
  as well as that of a `decimal64`.

  significand:
    description: The significant digits of the number.
    type: integer
    format: int64
  exponent:
    description: |
      Represents the position of the decimal point within the significand.

      When the exponent is 0, the value of the Decimal is simply the value of
      `significand`.

      When the exponent is greater than 0, represents the number of trailing
      zeroes after the significant digits.

      When the exponent is < less than, represents how many of the
      significant digits (and implicit leading zeroes, as needed) come after
      the decmial point.
